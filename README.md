# Auto-Renew-Craigslist
This script will automatically renew a craigslist listing and it will email you a notification when it runs with the link to the ad. Within the script is a comment that
shows a cron-job being ran at 10:30 on Mondays, Thursdays and Sundays. You will need to make a cronjob using that command in order for the script to automatically run
for you. Pretty helpful if you're selling or advertising something on craiglist and you don't feel like renewing the listing.
